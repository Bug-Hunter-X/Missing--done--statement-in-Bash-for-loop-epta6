This repository demonstrates a common error in bash scripting: a missing 'done' statement in a 'for' loop. The script attempts to process a list of files, but due to the missing 'done', the loop never terminates correctly. This leads to unexpected behavior or hangs.

The solution shows how to fix this by simply adding the missing 'done' statement.
